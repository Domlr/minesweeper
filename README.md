This is a minesweeper game quiz demo.

Clicking a mine ends the game.
Clicking a square with an adjacent mine clears that square and shows the number of mines touching it.
Clicking a square with no adjacent mine clears that square and clicks all adjacent squares.
The first click will never be a mine, it will clear the map and place numbers on the grid.
The numbers reflect the number of mines touching a square.
Right clicking on a square puts a flag on it. The flagged square canâ€™t be opened by a click.

There is also a highscores section that persists and you can reset the game and score using the UI.
